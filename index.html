	<p>The volume of water dispensed on US soil by Hurricane Harvey was so vast it caused the Earth’s crust to give way and sink under the weight.

Around 33 trillion gallons of water was left behind by the hurricane — four times the amount left by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The flooding added around 275 trillion pounds of weight to the landmass of the southern US region, according to calculations by The Atlantic.

The position of the continents were similar to today and the seas were flourishing with life.

Now, Dunn notes, "we suppress 97 or 98% of fires such that we experience the 2 or 3% that are really bad, where we have no chance of successful suppression because they're just so explosive."
